# Tabulazer
A Chrome Extension to filter, sort, page and style any existing HTML table using the Tabulator JS library.

## Introduction
Do you work with websites featuring a lot of HTML tables? Would you like to filter, sort and/or page them?  If so, then this lightweight extension might be useful. 

You can use it to transform any standard table into a fully-featured interactive table with the following features:

* Real-time column sorting (and reverse sorting)
* Real-time column filtering (using full-text search)
* Width enlarge to 100% (to increase readability)
* Dynamic paging (useful for very long tables)
* Resizable columns (using mouse handlers)

... and more!

Highly recommended if you're dealing with big tables and need to quickly extract relevant data from them.

The transformation is done using <a href="http://tabulator.info/" target="_blank">Tabulator</a>, a great table management JS library made by <a href="https://github.com/olifolkerd">Oli Folkerd</a> which I'm extensively using in all my web-based projects.
